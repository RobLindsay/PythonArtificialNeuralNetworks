Similar to previous submissions, I used my slightly altered version of the SeoulBikData.csv as I had issues with loading the special characters.  

The file should in the same location as the notebook file.

You can scroll down about 20-25% of the way until you see "Assignment 3".  This will bypass the initial data formatting and some carry over code from assignment 2.

At the beginning of each model approach there is a variable called RunBigTest.  It is set to either True or False.  
	True will run a more extensive search
	False will run a "Little Test" 
	Adjusting the variables should not create an issue with the code but there may be something I didn't account for in the subplotting if you change something. 
		I spent a significant amount of time trying to make sure that it did not matter what combinations, BUT.....
		I wouldn't do anymore than 5 batch sizes

My infant son and I caught a pretty nasty virus so some of the things I was hoping to implement from assignment 2 were not implemented here.
